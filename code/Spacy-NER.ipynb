       " Summary I have two decades of data intensive computing experience. I am passionate about applying data strategy together with business driven technology to solve industrial problems.  I have a strong record of success in leading, managing and delivering top tier innovative technology to align and achieve organisation needs and goals. I am currently the Head of Data Science and Analytics at Central Bank of Malaysia where I lead a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers responsible to provide advance analytics in the Bank.  Prior to the Bank,  I worked at MIMOS Berhad, Malaysia's national Applied R&amp;D institute, where I led data vision and products roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, Data-intensive analytics, and Cloud IaaS &amp; PaaS technologies.   My early work experiences was in computational science and High Performance Computing (HPC) system runtime software and architecture at a prestigious US national laboratory to support groundbreaking scientific discoveries.   I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UK and B.S and M.S in Computer Science from US.  I frequently speak at international conferences, and contributed extensively to the industry through 52 filed patents, 2 book chapters and 80 refereed papers.  Apart from my day job, I am serving as Industry Advisor to Universities and Advisory Consultant to public and private sectors.  In my spare time, beside spending quality time with my family, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies and various intelligent systems, particularly in the area of HPC and Machine Learning, and thinking about their applicability in private/public sectors and their social impacts.

As a data leader, I lead the team's strategy &amp; growth, along with engaging on the deep technical content the team is driving. As a team, we drive the data science and analytics vision in the Bank, which spans across strategy, people, processes and technology in supporting the Bank’s move towards becoming a data and insight-driven organisation.   MIMOS Berhad 7 years 11 months Senior Director, Corporate Technology June 2015 - August 2020 (5 years 3 months) Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia During my tenure here, I headed three departments, namely Advanced Computing Lab (ACL), Accelerative Technology Lab (ATL), and Artificial Intelligence Lab (AIL). ACL is recognized as particularly strong in the areas of system software and architecture.  We investigate these areas in the context of emerging computing paradigms such as cloud computing, mobile computing, data- intensive computing, and edge computing, and explore their utilisation in supporting enterprise applications. Currently focusing on using lean virtualisation technologies to manage Internet-of-Things (IoTs) applications at the network edge.   For storage area, our work focus on data protection and availability, long-term data preservation, and storage optimization.  As for   Page 2 of 4     network virtualization, we focus on cloud-based network policy and security. Since 2012, we have developed and deployed our cloud and storage platforms to public and private sectors.  ATL investigates the use of Accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for industrial and scientific applications. We applied the state-of-the-art of parallel computational algorithms and implemented them as libraries, interfaces, or accelerative components. Since 2012, ATL has developed and deployed to industries including GPU Graph/Text Analytics, GPU Image Processing for Multi-Video Analytic, GPU SQL query Accelerator, and GPU Accelerated Library (Mi- AccLib).  AIL focuses on Artificial Intelligence technology to develop high performance Intelligent Big Data Analytics. The R&amp;D team applies Data Science and Knowledge Science technologies like Machine Learning, Semantic Technology, large scale Graph Analytics, and Natural Language Processing for deriving insights from the  unstructured and structured data.
